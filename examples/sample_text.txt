**Fictional News Article: AI Code Revolution: LLMs Reshape Software Development**
In a stunning turn of events, large language models (LLMs) like Codex and GPT have surged in popularity, taking the tech world by storm. Developers are increasingly relying on these AI tools to write, debug, and optimize code at record speed. 
One senior developer, Alex Rivera, stated, "I barely touched my keyboard this week. My LLM handled the backend development, while I sipped coffee and pretended to understand the AI's output."
Critics warn of potential over-reliance, with some joking that future programmers might only need to write, "Dear AI, make an app," and call it a day. Meanwhile, industry leaders predict that by 2030, the world may see the first AI-generated programming languages. Whether this is progress or chaos is a debate for another day.
